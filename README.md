# Link Profile Template
The HTML and CSS codes in this repository are cloned from the [Linktree](https://linktr.ee) black theme. The purpose of this repository is to collect links from social media or other websites in a single profile. Some people want to set up a profile like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee) for their domain name, but cannot find a theme. That's why I cloned the Linktree dark black theme and created it as a Github repository. Those who want to use it can clone the repository and add and edit their own links.

Example social media icon code:
Change the link address and SVG codes.

You can make the theme design as you want by changing the codes in the style.css file under the subfolder. Also don't forget to change SEO related stuff from Meta tags.
